\section*{Introduction}
\label{Introduktion}
This paper has been written for the course \textit{Prototyping and Fabrication Techniques} at Aalborg University. It describes the design process and the making of a conceptual prototype which will allow the user to have a simple drum kit at their fingertips. It is not meant to be a finished product but rather a simple prototype which supports further development of the concept. 
The prototype ended up using five Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR) attached to a glove, and an Arduino Uno with a custom shield made to connect to the FSRs via a wire. The Arduino uses the Firmata Protocol to communicate the signals from the FSRs to a PC where Processing was used to analyse the signals and play the appropriate drum sounds. The paper contains a further work section which will describe the current problems and propose the next possible iteration in order to address some of these problems.
