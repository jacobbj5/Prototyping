\section*{Introduction}
\label{Introduktion}
This paper has been written for the course \textit{Prototyping and Fabrication Techniques} at Aalborg University. It describes the design process and the making of a conceptual prototype which will allow the user to have a simple drum kit at their fingertips. The prototype ended up using five Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR) attached to a glove, and an Arduino Uno with a custom shield made to fit the FSRs properly. The Arduino communicated the data to a PC equipped with Processing and the Firmata protocol from the Arduino Firmata library. The paper contains a further work section which will describe the current problems and propose the next possible iteration in order to address some of these problems.
